1. Enter "git clone https://github.com/taras-hrdu/Sixth" in console
2. Create virtual environment being in folder of that project
3. Activate virtual environment 
4. Install flask_sqlalchemy, flask_marshmallow, marshmallow-sqlalchemy
5. Being in folder of that project create database: write in terminal "python" then ">>> from device_service import db >>> db.create_all()"
6. Run flask app
7. Go to the instrument of API testing, open "http://localhost:5000/devices" and test methods GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
